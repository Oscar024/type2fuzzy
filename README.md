Project Description

A type-2 fuzzy logic library providing:

Ways to define and work with general type-2 fuzzy sets.
Ways to define and work with interval type-2 fuzzy sets.
Ways to generate z-sliced sets from general type-2 fuzzy sets.
Functions to perform wavy-slice type-reduction (Mendel-John) on general type-2 fuzzy sets.
Functions to perform interval type-2 reduction (Karnik-Mendel).
Functions to perform partial-centroid type-reduction on general type-2 fuzzy sets.
Functions to perform defuzzification of type-1 fuzzy sets.
Tools to measure the performance of algorithms.
Tools to plot general, interval and z-sliced type-2 fuzzy sets and type-1 fuzzy sets.

and more...
